A Flutter application to track the ongoing status of the COVID-19 cases. 

The data we provide is collected from [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/), the US [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/), the [Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)](http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/), [Chinaâ€™s National Health Commission](http://en.nhc.gov.cn/), and Chinese website DXY which provides regional case estimates faster than the national level reporting organizations.

The [API]( https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/ ) was used to provide the data. The [www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/) was used to provide the guides.
